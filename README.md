**VeriFund** is a decentralized, trustless platform built to revolutionize how people give. Powered by the Internet Computer, VeriFund allows anyone to create or contribute to donation campaigns with transparency, verifiability, and global accessibility.

Every donation is stored on-chain, publicly auditable, and protected by smart contract rules ‚Äî ensuring that funds are not only received, but responsibly used. With a unique **proof-of-donation** and **proof-of-usage** model, VeriFund builds a culture of accountability without compromise.

## ‚ùì Why?

Charity and donation systems across the world face a persistent and growing crisis: a lack of transparency, traceability, and trust. According to the **Charities Aid Foundation (CAF World Giving Index 2023)**:

* Global trust in NGOs and charitable institutions declined by over 10% in the past five years.
* $2.6 trillion in global donations yearly remain largely unverifiable in their usage.

Moreover:

* 80% of global donors say they would increase contributions if they could see exactly how donations are used.
* Scandals involving misuse of charity funds (e.g., Red Cross Haiti, Wounded Warrior Project) have damaged donor confidence worldwide.
* Most donations rely on centralized organizations acting as trusted intermediaries, which introduce high administrative costs and regional limitations.

At the same time, blockchain has matured to enable:

* Immutable on-chain data
* Transparent smart contract logic
* Decentralized identity (Internet Identity)
* Secure off-chain integrations (HTTPS outcalls)

VeriFund emerges to solve this pressing global need for trustless, proof-based, on-chain donation systems, enabling borderless giving with verifiable usage.

## üí°Solution & Opportunity: VeriFund 

VeriFund is not just a donation platform ‚Äî it's an ecosystem of accountability, built on a blockchain that can actually support it i.e. the Internet Computer Protocol (ICP) that isn‚Äôt just another smart contract chain. It's the only blockchain that allows developers to build full-stack decentralized applications, including:

| ICP Capability         | Why It Matters for VeriFund                                                                                   |
|------------------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| On-chain compute   | VeriFund logic (timers, randomness, staking, auditing) runs fully on-chain, not just payment transactions.   |
| On-chain storage   | All campaign data, donations, and usage reports are stored and served directly from the chain ‚Äî no centralized servers. |
| HTTPS Outcalls   | VeriFund can fetch and verify live data (e.g., price feeds, file links, external APIs) directly from the canister. |
| Certified Queries  | Donors see cryptographically certified frontend data, ensuring frontend integrity.                          |
| Internet Identity  | Users can login without passwords, securely and privately across devices.                                  |
| Autonomous Timers  | VeriFund can remind fundraisers daily, or trigger automated audits ‚Äî all on-chain.                         |
| Near-zero gas fees | Enables microdonations, global access, and predictable costs.                                               |

This makes ICP the only chain where a system like VeriFund could emerge without depending on bridges, oracles, or Web2 services.

#### üîó VeriFund introduces a new donation paradigm where:

* **Every donation is public, verifiable, and tamper-proof**: Donors can check exactly when and how much was donated, down to the wallet.
* **Proof-of-usage is required and audited**: Fundraisers must submit links or files (in future: FileVault), and these are reviewed by randomly selected public auditors.
* **Auditors stake ICP to participate**: They have skin in the game: honest actors are rewarded; inactive ones are penalized.
* **All data is on-chain and certifiable**: Even the frontend views shown to users are backed by certified data, making fake interfaces impossible.
* **Global, borderless donations are enabled**: Donors use ICP, a crypto-native, low-fee token ‚Äî no banks, no PayPal, no restrictions.
* **VeriFund is fully decentralized**: No central authority controls funds. All logic is transparent, auditable, and upgradeable.

#### üåç Opportunity 

* Small grassroots campaigns in underserved regions can raise funds internationally.
* Disaster relief efforts can be tracked and verified by the public.
* NGOs and aid groups can prove transparency without costly reporting overhead.
* Auditors become incentivized third parties, not internal staff.

## üèóÔ∏è How to Build

### Required Tech Stack (install first if not available)
- DFX CLI (https://internetcomputer.org/docs/current/developer-docs/setup/install/)
- Node.js & NPM (https://nodejs.org)
- Motoko Package Manager (Mops)

### 1. Install developer tools.

You can install the developer tools natively or use Dev Containers.

#### Option 1: Natively install developer tools

> Installing `dfx` natively is currently only supported on macOS and Linux systems. On Windows, it is recommended to use the Dev Containers option.

1. Install `dfx` with the following command:

```

sh -ci "$(curl -fsSL https://internetcomputer.org/install.sh)"

```

> On Apple Silicon (e.g., Apple M1 chip), make sure you have Rosetta installed (`softwareupdate --install-rosetta`).

2. [Install NodeJS](https://nodejs.org/en/download/package-manager).

3. For Motoko projects, you will also need to:

- Install the Motoko package manager [Mops](https://docs.mops.one/quick-start#2-install-mops-cli): 
```bash
npm i -g ic-mops
```

#### Option 2: Dev Containers

Continue building your projects locally by installing the [Dev Container extension](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ms-vscode-remote.remote-containers) for VS Code and [Docker](https://docs.docker.com/engine/install/).

Make sure Docker is running, then navigate into your project's directory that you downloaded from ICP Ninja and start the Dev Container by selecting `Dev-Containers: Reopen in Container` in VS Code's command palette (F1 or Ctrl/Cmd+Shift+P).

> Note that local development ports (e.g. the ports used by `dfx` or `vite`) are forwarded from the Dev Container to your local machine. In the VS code terminal, use Ctrl/Cmd+Click on the displayed local URLs to open them in your browser. To view the current port mappings, click the "Ports" tab in the VS Code terminal window.

### 2. Clone or enter your project
 ```bash
git clone https://github.com/Incheon21/verifund.git
cd verifund
 ```

### 3. Start local DFX network
 ``` bash
dfx start --background
 ```

### 4. (Recommended) Create and switch to your dev identity
  ```
dfx identity new dev
dfx identity use dev
 ```

### 5. Install frontend dependencies
 ```
npm install
 ```

### 6. Deploy canisters locally
 ```
dfx deploy
 ```
